## Install

```
$ npm install --global arvis-bitly
```

## First Run

Before running the workflow you need to set your Bit.ly **GENERIC ACCESS TOKEN**:

First [login to your Bitly Account](https://bitly.com/a/sign_in) and then create [here](https://bitly.com/a/sign_in?rd=%2Fa%2Foauth_apps) your **GENERIC ACCESS TOKEN**. Be sure to use the **GENERIC ACCESS TOKEN** and not the **API KEY**.

To enter it open arvis Preferences window > workflow > click arvis-bitly and user config.

Add **GENERIC ACCESS TOKEN** to user config.

## Usage

Copy URL to clipboard. Type `bitly` in arvis and <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Now the shorten URL should be in your clipboard.
